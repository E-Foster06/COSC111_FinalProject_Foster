### description: 
This is the final project for COSC 111 that demonstrates my mastery of objecs, classes, methods, and basic java concepts. The application simulates a library system, allowing users to manage books and libraries, track checkouts, and update book information.

### How to run my program: 
#### dependancys : Java 8 +
Run the java program (Managment.java) either from an ide or from your terminal. Menus always expect an intager input, follow on screen prompts for other text inputs (Titles, Authors, Borrowers, etc.).

### Short summary / features: 
This program has many features, search functionality for books by title, checkout and return with borrower information storage, a catalog view of all books and their information, the ability to save and load books and their locations and librarys in a .txt file (example save file provided).
